# Brain Tumor Prediction Using CNN

## Overview
This project aims to predict brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is designed to classify images into categories with or without brain tumors, leveraging deep learning techniques for accurate predictions.

## Features
- **Data Handling**: Image data preprocessing and augmentation.
- **Model**: Custom CNN architecture with layers like Conv2D, MaxPool2D, Dropout, and BatchNormalization.
- **Optimization**: Uses Adam optimizer and data augmentation for improved model performance.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics include accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC score.

## Libraries Used
- `TensorFlow`, `Keras`
- `OpenCV`, `PIL`
- `pandas`, `numpy`
- `seaborn`, `matplotlib`

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
2. Adjust the hyperparameters and data augmentation techniques to improve accuracy.
